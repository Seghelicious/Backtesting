# Backtesting

This is the eighth project in the AI for trading Nanodegree.

In this project, 
- I shall build a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. 
- The backtester shall perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs 
- I shall implement it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. 
- I shall also use performance attribution to identify the major drivers of your portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL). 
- I shall have the option to modify and customize the backtest as well.
